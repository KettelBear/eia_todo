# Elixir In Action (EIA) Todo App

Going through the chapters of Elixir In Action (3e), the author has the reader
follow along in making a Todo list application. This repository will serve as
my follow along, as I continue to learn from the book.

Hopefully I'll remember to include comments if I do anything that is distinctly
different from the book.
